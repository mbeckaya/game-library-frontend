A React project built with Vite, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

The application connects to the
👉 [game-library-api](https://github.com/mbeckaya/game-library-api)

and provides two main views:

## 📄 Views
### 1. All Games View (Table)

The main screen displays all games in a responsive table.
The view loads data from the API and shows essential fields such as title, platform, publisher, release year, and format (physical/digital).

### 2. Game Detail View

Selecting a game opens a dedicated detail page showing extended information about the selected game, formatted with Tailwind and structured into labeled fields.

More features—such as CRUD operations, filters, sorting, and UI components—are currently in development.
